# Step by step, Algebruh, whatever you want to call it
This is a shoddily put together website I originally made in high school as part of a Grade 12 computer science project. It suffered hard with senioritis while on the other hand, I enjoyed every minute of it.
Includes an algebra equation solver and derivative taker
**NEW: Matrix page for row reduced echelon form**
Things I'll do eventually
- Make it evaluate limits properly
- Turn the derivative into step by step too
- Rebrand as Algebruh
- Make the matrix solver work with any number of rows and columns
- Make the matrix solver step by step too by writing my own Gauss-Jordan eliminator
